                <h3>Sim3D - Realtime Cloth Simulation and Physics Engine</h3>
                <p>
                    A 3D physics simulation engine developed from scratch in C++ using OpenGL. It features a mass-spring system for textured cloth simulation, advanced lighting with Phong shading, and efficient rendering techniques. The engine includes a particle system with uniform grid-based collision detection and an interactive scene editor built with ImGui. Object-Oriented principles were applied to ensure a modular and extensible design.

                <h3>DreamLab - Latent Diffusion Transformer for Text2Video Generation</h3>
                <p>
                    This project is a smaller-scale implementation of a text-to-video generation model, inspired by OpenAI's Sora. I designed and experimented with various autoencoder architectures, focusing on minimizing quality loss through a combination of perceptual and reconstruction losses. I implemented the denoising process using a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture and am currently working on incorporating spatio-temporal attention and text conditioning with CLIP embeddings.

                <h3>Image Captioning using CNN + RNN on Flickr8k Dataset</h3>
                <p>
                    I built a pipeline to generate captions for images using a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The CNN, similar to the VGG-16 architecture, was optimized for feature extraction from images. These features were then fed into a single-layer RNN to generate descriptive captions. The entire model was trained from scratch on the Flickr8k dataset.

                <h3>Deep Learning Model from Scratch in Java</h3>
                <p>
                    To deepen my understanding of fundamental deep learning concepts, I implemented a neural network from scratch in Java. This included forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent. I trained this model on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset and achieved a test accuracy of up to 80%.
